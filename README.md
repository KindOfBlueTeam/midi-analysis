# Atmo Audio Toolbox

A Python tool for comprehensive audio and MIDI file analysis, with a web UI and CLI. Designed to handle real-world MIDI files including those exported from AI music generators like Suno, which often contain corrupt metadata.

## Features

### Analysis
| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| **Key & Mode** | Krumhansl-Schmuckler key detection across major/minor/modal flavors |
| **Modulation** | Detects high-confidence key changes and displays the full modulation path (e.g. `C → F#m → Bb`) |
| **Tempo** | Initial BPM, tempo type (constant/variable), BPM range, and tempo change timeline |
| **Dynamics** | Average velocity, dynamic range, velocity distribution bar chart, humanness score |
| **Quantization** | Measures how tightly notes align to the 16th-note grid — a "human vs. software" timing score |
| **Structure** | Note count, polyphony, note range, time signature, instruments per channel |

### Actions
| Action | Description |
|---|---|
| **Humanize Velocity** | Adds gaussian velocity variation at three intensity levels — makes machine-generated MIDI sound more naturally played |
| **Normalize Velocity** | Shifts all velocities so the average lands in the mp–mf range, preserving relative dynamics |
| **Humanize Timing** | Nudges note onsets slightly off the beat grid at three intensity levels — removes the "quantized" feel |

All processing is done in memory. No files are written to disk on the server.

## Screenshots

The web interface provides drag-and-drop file upload and displays all analysis results in a clean dark-themed layout.

## Installation

Requires Python 3.9+.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KindOfBlueTeam/atmo-audio-toolbox.git
cd atmo-audio-toolbox
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate       # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -e ".[web]"
```

---

## Usage

### Web Interface

```bash
atmo-audio-toolbox web
```

Opens at [http://localhost:8010](http://localhost:8010). Drag and drop any `.mid` or `.midi` file to analyze it. Use the action buttons to download humanized or normalized versions.

Options:
```bash
atmo-audio-toolbox web --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080 --debug
```

### Command Line

```bash
atmo-audio-toolbox analyze path/to/file.mid
atmo-audio-toolbox analyze path/to/file.mid --json
```

## API

The web server exposes a simple REST API:

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `/api/analyze` | POST | Analyze a MIDI file, returns JSON |
| `/api/humanize` | POST | Randomize velocities (intensity 1–3), returns `.mid` |
| `/api/normalize-velocity` | POST | Shift velocities to mp–mf average, returns `.mid` |
| `/api/humanize-timing` | POST | Nudge note onsets off the beat grid (intensity 1–3), returns `.mid` |

All endpoints accept `multipart/form-data` with a `midi_file` field. Max file size: 16MB.

## Humanization Details

### Velocity Humanization
Applies gaussian noise (σ = 5 / 12 / 20 velocity units for intensity 1 / 2 / 3) to each note's velocity, plus a small accent on downbeats and beat 3. Velocities are clamped to 1–127.

### Velocity Normalization
Computes the mean velocity across all notes and applies a constant offset so the new mean is 72 (mf). Relative dynamics are fully preserved.

### Timing Humanization
Converts all events to absolute ticks, applies gaussian noise (σ = 5% / 10% / 17% of a 16th note for intensity 1 / 2 / 3) to each note onset, re-sorts events, then converts back to delta times. Note-off events at the same tick are always sorted before note-on events to prevent stuck notes.

## Corrupt MIDI Handling

The custom `midi_parser.py` ignores all meta events (key signatures, tempo, lyrics, etc.) and extracts only note-on/note-off events. This allows it to parse files that crash standard MIDI libraries — including many files exported from Suno, which write out-of-range key signature values. The web endpoints that process files for download also sanitize key signature bytes before passing them to `mido`.
